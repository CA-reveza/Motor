-- MOTOR schema: profiles, bookings, ratings
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor. Safe to run multiple times — table/
-- function/policy creation is all guarded (create if not exists, drop-then-
-- create for policies), so re-running after an update to this file just
-- applies whatever's new.


-- 1. Profiles (extends auth.users)
create table if not exists profiles (
  id uuid primary key references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  full_name text not null,
  phone text,
  role text not null check (role in ('customer', 'driver', 'admin')),
  is_online boolean default false,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- 2. Bookings
create table if not exists bookings (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  customer_id uuid not null references profiles(id) on delete cascade,
  driver_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete set null,
  pickup_address text not null,

  distance_km numeric not null default 1,
  vehicle_type text not null,
  status text not null default 'pending'
    check (status in ('pending', 'accepted', 'picked_up', 'in_transit', 'completed', 'cancelled')),

  fare_final numeric,
  notes text,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  accepted_at timestamptz,
  picked_up_at timestamptz,
  completed_at timestamptz

-- `create table if not exists` above doesn't add columns to a table that
-- already existed from an earlier run — these fill it in either way.

create table if not exists ratings (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  booking_id uuid not null references bookings(id) on delete cascade,
  driver_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete set null,
  rating int not null check (rating between 1 and 5),
  comment text,
  created_at timestamptz default now()

-- full_name / phone / role out of the metadata passed to supabase.auth.signUp().

-- into profiles directly.
